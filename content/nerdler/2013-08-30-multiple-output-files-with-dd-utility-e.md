I just used this method to create a file MD5 "on the fly" meaning, one read operation when moving the file to a destination.  
  
`dd if=test.txt | tee >(md5 >> tmp/test.txt.md5) | dd of=tmp/test.txt` or you can reverse the order of the destination and MD5  
`dd if=test.txt | tee >(dd of=tmp/test.txt) | md5 >> tmp/test.txt.md5`  
  
This worked for me. Â The usage case would be when copying a file from "local" media to "remote" media (ex: local HDD to SAN volume)
