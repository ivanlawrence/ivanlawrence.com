# Background
I've been climbing on and off for about 100yrs (I'm that old)... here is a [photo album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9iT7Jt7ASXcnVG4Y8) to prove it.

# Locations
There are a few frequent places I go... [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200291696/ivan-lawrence) shows a few but really its mostly Point Dume.

# Gear
I bought a crash pad, less for bouldering and more for the first clip... and it folds into a couch!
[Mad Pad Crash Pad](https://www.backcountry.com/mad-rock-mad-pad-crash-pad-mrc0004)

I have a nice climbing rope (I cant find the stats or brand) some static canyon ropes and an old static 11mm "rescue" rope which is crazy heavy.

I have a zip-line carriage, and figure 8s, all the things.
