# What about me?
I've done a little bit of everything...

# Hobbies
In no particular order
- Indoor Skydiving at iFly
- Rock Climbing [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200291696/ivan-lawrence)
- Scout Master (I earned my Eagle as a kid and still love it)
- Snowboarding (proudly annoying skiers since about 1998)
- Motorcycles (mostly sport bikes)
    - as a kid got my start on an old Honda Trail 50
    - as a young adult I borrowed my bro's Kawasaki Ninja 250
    - my first bike was a 2000 Suzuki Katana 600 in electric blue, I put about 80k miles before selling her to a friend
    - my 2006 CBR1000RR was stolen from my home with only about 15k miles on it; the thieves striped it and dumped it in the desert

# Family
I've been married for about 100yrs now and have some kids so I'm enjoying this chapter of life
